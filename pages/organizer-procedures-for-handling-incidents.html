    <p>Be sure to have a good understanding of the <a href="http://chicagopythonworkshop.github.io/pages/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Also have a good understanding of what is expected from an attendee that wants
to report a harassment incident. These guidelines can be found here: <a href="http://chicagopythonworkshop.github.io/pages/attendee-procedures-for-reporting-incidents.html">Attendee
Procedures for Reporting Incidents</a></p>
<p>Try to get as much of the incident in written form by the reporter. If you
cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you. The important information
to gather includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying information of the participant doing the harassing</li>
<li>The behavior that was in violation</li>
<li>The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made) </li>
<li>The circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
<li>Other people involved in the incident</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare an initial response to the incident. This initial response is very
important and will set the tone for this and future events. Depending on the
severity/details of the incident, please follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is any general threat to attendees or the safety of anyone including
  conference staff is in doubt, summon security or police.</li>
<li>Offer the reporter a private place to sit</li>
<li>Ask "is there a friend or trusted person who you would like to be with you?"
  (if so, arrange for someone to fetch this person)</li>
<li>Ask them "how can I help?"</li>
<li>Provide them with your list of emergency contacts if they need help later</li>
<li>If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only on request.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is
  OK. This suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. "If
  you're OK with pursuing the complaint" suggests that you are by default
  pursuing it and is not coercive.</li>
<li>Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a
  staff responsibility</li>
<li>Do not offer them input into penalties. This is a staff responsibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Once something is reported to a staff member, immediately meet with the
workshop coordinator. The main objectives of this meeting is to find out the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happened?</li>
<li>Are we doing anything about it?</li>
<li>Who is doing those things?</li>
<li>When are they doing them?</li>
</ul>
<p>After the staff meeting and discussion, have a staff member communicate with
the alleged harasser. Make sure to inform them of what has been reported about
them. Allow the alleged harasser to give their side of the story to the staff.
After this point, if report stands, let the alleged harasser know what actions
will be taken against them.</p>
<p>Some actions for the staff to consider when dealing with Code of Conduct offenders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions</li>
<li>Requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
  proximity to, the reporter for the remainder of the event</li>
<li>Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the
  harasser holds</li>
<li>Requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future events your organization
  runs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)</li>
<li>Requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return</li>
<li>Banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)</li>
<li>Publishing an account of the harassment and calling for the resignation of
  the harasser from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without
  formal authority: may be called for if the harasser is the event leader, or
  refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest, or similar, typically
  event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this isn't
  as useful)</li>
</ul>
<p>Give accused attendees a place to appeal to if there is one, but in the
meantime the report stands. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to
encourage an apology from the harasser. </p>
<p>It is very important how we deal with the incident publicly. Our policy is to
make sure that everyone aware of the initial incident is also made aware that
it is not according to policy and that official action has been taken - while
still respecting the privacy of individual attendees. When speaking to
individuals (those who are aware of the incident, but were not involved with
the incident) about the incident it is a good idea to keep the details out. </p>
<p>Depending on the incident, the organizer or designate may decide to make one or
more public announcements. No one other than the organizer or someone delegated
authority should make any announcements. It is best to apologize immediately
that the incident occurred. If there are residual hard feelings, suggest that
people contact event organizers at CONTACT It will be dealt with accordingly.</p>
