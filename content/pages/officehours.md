Title: Python Office Hours
URL:
save_as: officehours.html

Python Office Hours is a chance for people of all experiences levels to get
together for programming, socializing, and moral support while working on
things. This is a flipped "office hours" where you can learn from your peers.
In flipped classrooms students watch lectures and read material outside the
classroom then work on things in person. This isn't a formal class, but the
idea is similar. Many people who attend are there to help.

If you prefer to work on things on your own, that is okay too! If someone asks
for help, let them know that you are working on something and not available for
help at the moment.

If you don't already have something to work on or study, look for ideas in [Learning Resources]({filename}./learning.md).
