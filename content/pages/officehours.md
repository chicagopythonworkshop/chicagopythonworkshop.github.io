Title: Python Office Hours
URL:
save_as: pyoo.html


Python Office Hours is a chance for people of all experiences levels to get
together for programming, socializing, and moral support while working on
things. This is a flipped "office hours" where you can learn from your peers.
In flipped classrooms students watch lectures and read material outside the
classroom then work on things in person. This isn't a formal class, but the
idea is similar. Many people who attend are there to help.

If you prefer to work on things on your own, that is okay too! If someone asks
for help, let them know that you are working on something and not available for
help at the moment.

If you don't already have something to work on or study, look through the resources below.

We meet every other Wednesday at [Pumping Station: One](http://pumpingstationone.org/) in
the electronics area upstairs unless another event is meeting there. Check
the [events calendar](http://pumpingstationone.org/events/) to see if the meeting is this
week. RSVP at [Chicago Pythonistas Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPythonistas/).
We don't require it, but it helps us know how much space we need. Warning: We don't have an elevator.

## Learning Resources

### Online Python Interpreters

If you want to try out python and scientific packages before installing
everything, you can use these services.

* https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ many different python shells. python, ipython, pypy (need account)
* https://www.wakari.io/ ipython notebook (need account)


### Learning Python

* The official Python [tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/): This
  tutorial is very comprehensive, but it sometimes throws in unnecessarily
  advanced concepts. This is a solid tutorial for people with prior programming
  experience, and is still a good tutorial for new programmers if you are willing
  to skip over the advanced concepts and come back to them later.
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with
  Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html):
  This interactive tutorial does a particularly good job of introducing
  programming concepts and terminology.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book): Despite
  the name, some people find this to be a gentler introduction than the
  official Python tutorial.
* Learn programming by visualizing code execution: [Online Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/)
* [Software Carpentry: Programming With Python](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/python/index.html):
  "The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this
  introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: data
  analysis."


### Practicing Python

* Practice Python online with bite-sized exercises at [python CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/python).
* [NewCoder](http://newcoder.io/) is for when you get to the point where you
  say "Well, I worked through this beginner book. Now what?" It has tutorials
  on Data Visualization, APIs, Web Scraping, Networking
* The [Boston Python Workshop](http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/) has introductory and intermediate materials
    * custom [CodingBat](http://openhatch.org/wiki/CodingBat) exercises
    * [Boston Python Workshop projects](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_6/Saturday_projects)
    * [Intermediate Python Workshop Projects](http://bit.ly/intermediate-python-projects)
    * [Scrabble challenge](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Scrabble_challenge)

### Projects

* Learn a Python web framework
    * Check out the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/)
    * Check out [Flask Tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/#tutorial)
* [Get started with pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)
* [Matplotlib tutorial](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/pyplot_tutorial.html)

### Books and Reading

* I need a few "best in class" book suggestions.
* [Two Scoops of Django](http://twoscoopspress.org/collections/everything): an excellent introduction to
  Django. Work through the Django tutorial, then read this!
* [The Hitchhiker's Guide to
  Python](http://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): This is a guide for
  python developers that gives an overlay of the land of python development. In
  the guide's words: "The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python exists to provide both
  novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the
  installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis."

### Online Course Providers

These are some of many of the places that offer python related MOOCs. I used to list specific classes
here but there got to be too many.

* [edX](https://www.edx.org/)
* [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org/courses Coursera)
* [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/ Udacity)
* [Python Learn](http://pythonlearn.com/)
