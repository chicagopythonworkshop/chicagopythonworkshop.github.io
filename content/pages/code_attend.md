Title: Attendee Procedures for Reporting Incidents
Category: CodeofConduct

Keep in mind that workshop staff will be introduced at the event.
The staff will be prepared to handle incidents. All of our staff are informed
of the code of conduct and will be informed on how to deal with harassment at
the workshop.

Report the harassment incident to a staff member. All reports are confidential.
When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as
available, but do not interview people about the incident. Staff will assist
you in writing the report/collecting information. 

The important information consists of:

* Identifying information of the participant doing the harassing
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in the incident
