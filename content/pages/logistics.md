> Some quick thoughts:
> 
> You've probably seen
> [A Guide to Running a Python User Group / Project night](http://user-groups-beta.openhatch.org/#project-night)
> -- I'd love to incorporate your ideas into that doc, too. Check out the
> user-groups-beta guide; it has a few tips I stand behind. Heck, I'll paste
> them here:
> 
> * Inviting language on your event page to indicate all are welcome, whether
> newcomers, experienced Python programmers, or something else.
> 
> * A collection of volunteers who are willing to spend the evening answering
> others' questions.
> 
> * A landing page for newcomers with links to tested resources. You can base
> yours off this page: https://openhatch.org/wiki/Project_night
> 
> * A food sponsor, if possible.
> 
> and this intro text:
> 
> > Hello, everyone! I'm _name_, organizer of this Python user group.
> 
> > Thanks for coming to the project night. We have wifi here, and food and
> > drinks that you can take; thanks to _sponsor name_ for making that possible.
> 
> > We're excited about having people of all experience levels in Python here
> > today, and to support them, we have a few people who are excited about
> > helping beginners. Can I get those people to stand up?
> 
> > We've labeled a table as the "Beginner's corner," so if you specially want
> > mentorship today, go visit there and say hi to the person next to you, and
> > talk with one of the lovely people who want to help you have a great time
> > with Python.
> 
> > I'll be here all evening, so if you need anything else, just ask me. Thanks
> > to all of you for coming!

> At event
> 
> * Show up to the venue a little early, and make sure food and drinks work
> out fine.
> 
> * At the venue, organize the seating into smallish groups (3-10 people per
> table), and put a white 8.5x11 sheet of paper on that table with the
> words, written with a Sharpie, "Newcomers corner".
> 
> * Optionally, also put a label on other tables, so people can self-sort
> into things they're interested in doing. Perhaps this list: "Django",
> "Non-Django web", "GIS", "Civic Hacking"
> 
> * When the event begins, stand up at the front and say: "Welcome to
> Project Night! I'm {{ NAME }}. Thanks for coming. The goal of the event is
> that people meet each other and/or work on projects related to Python that
> are interesting to them. The event is welcoming to newcomers, and so we've
> put some resources on the web and we have some people specially interested
> in helping newcomers. Can they stand up? Great, now all those people
> should be at the table labeled, 'Newcomers corner.' Same with the
> newcomers, if you want to be in a place where people want to help you.
> Thanks to our sponsors, {{ SPONSORNAMEHERE }}, and thanks to {{ HOSTNAME
> }} for providing space. Now, go forth and work on projects, or chat!"
> 
> * Be available for random questions about the event during the event.
> 
> * Optional: Take photos so that afterward, you can remember how
> amazingly great the event was.

> Cheers!
