## Which version? Which distribution? How do I install...?

Pick a version of python and start learning. It's easy to change your mind
later. They aren't radically different. You can even try out different
versions of python online before deciding what to install.

### Online Python Interpretors

* [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/): many different python shells. python, ipython, pypy (requires a free account)
* [Wakari](https://www.wakari.io/): scientific python stack with ipython notebook support. (requires a free account)

### Scientific Python Stack

Sometimes installing things is a hurdle. The SciPy Stack can be finicky, and
there are distributions that come tailored for it. Here
is a list of [Scientific Python distributions](http://www.scipy.org/install.html).

### No but really, Which version?

People have a lot of opinions on this topic. If you are curious, Read the stances in
The Hitchiker's Guide to Python on
* [Picking an Interpreter](http://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/starting/which-python/)
* Installing python on
    * [Mac OS X](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/),
    * [Windows](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/), and
    * [Linux](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux).

## Learning Python

* The official Python [tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/): This is a
  solid tutorial for people with prior programming experience, and is still a
  good tutorial for new programmers if you are willing to skip over the advanced
  concepts and come back to them later.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book): Despite
  the name, some people find this to be a gentler introduction than the
  official Python tutorial.
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with
  Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html):
  This interactive tutorial does a particularly good job of introducing
  programming concepts and terminology.
* Learn programming by visualizing code execution: [Online Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/)
* [Software Carpentry: Programming With Python](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/python/index.html):
  "The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this
  introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: data
  analysis."
* [Learning Python -- The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/) goes in
  to more detail for learning resources

## Practicing Python

* Practice Python online with bite-sized exercises at [python CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/python).
* [NewCoder](http://newcoder.io/) is for when you get to the point where you
  say "Well, I worked through this beginner book. Now what?" It has tutorials
  on Data Visualization, APIs, Web Scraping, Networking
* The [Boston Python Workshop](http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/) has introductory and intermediate materials
    * custom [CodingBat](http://openhatch.org/wiki/CodingBat) exercises
    * [Boston Python Workshop projects](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_6/Saturday_projects)
    * [Intermediate Python Workshop Projects](http://bit.ly/intermediate-python-projects)
    * [Scrabble challenge](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Scrabble_challenge)
* Learn a Python web framework
    * Check out the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/)
    * Check out [Flask Tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/#tutorial)
* [Get started with pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)
* [Matplotlib tutorial](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/pyplot_tutorial.html)

## Books and Reading

Please help expand this section.

* [Two Scoops of Django](http://twoscoopspress.org/collections/everything): an excellent introduction to
  Django. Work through the Django tutorial, then read this!

## Online Course Providers

Note that some courses only place materials online only when the class is being run.

## Curated Web Resources

* [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): This is a guide for
  python developers that gives an overlay of the land of python development. In
  the guide's words: "The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python exists to provide both
  novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the
  installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis."
* [Python for Non Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers): resources for beginning programmers.
