Title: Code of Conduct
Category: CodeofConduct


Chicago Python Project Night provides a professional setting for python
programmers of all backgrounds and experience levels to spend time working on
python projects. We want attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling
experience.


### The Short Version

Attendees and volunteers are expected to show sensitivity and courtesy to each
other during project nights and related social activities. All communication
should be appropriate for a professional context.

### The Long Version 

Attendees and volunteers are expected to refrain from harassing behavior. Harassing
behavior includes sexualized language or innuendo, slurs related to ethnicity,
gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation, disparaging remarks about any group of people,
unwanted sexual attention, deliberate intimidation, deliberate misgendering,
stalking, invasion of personal space, presentation of unprofessional material in event spaces,
violence, and disruptive behavior. These behaviors are antithetical to our goals,
and they can be alienating to attendees and volunteers.

### Procedures

Participants who engage in harassing behavior are to comply immediately when
asked to stop. The organizers may take actions ranging from warning the
offender to asking the offender to leave. A more detailed list of actions can
be found in the [Organizer Procedures for Handling Incidents]({filename}./code_staff.md)

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please let a volunteer know. Volunteers can be identified
by instructions given at the event. Volunteers will take action to help you.
Guidelines for reporting incidents can be found in the [Attendee Procedures for
Reporting Incidents]({filename}./code_attend.md).
