Title: Python Project Night
URL:
save_as: index.html

Come work on Python projects, get programming help, help others, and hang out.
Bring your own project or work on one of the suggested projects below. Everyone
is welcome, all skill levels are encouraged. Friendly people will be here to
help beginning Python programmers with language basics and practice. If you
prefer to work on things on your own, that is okay too!

_When and Where_: Look for specifics at the [Chicago Pythonistas Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPythonistas).

_Things to bring_: a wireless-enabled laptop and power cord.

_Read_: [Code of Conduct]({filename}./code.md)

Need something to do? How about:

### Learning Python

* The official Python [tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/): This tutorial is very comprehensive, but it sometimes throws in unnecessarily advanced concepts. This is a solid tutorial for people with prior programming experience, and is still a good tutorial for new programmers if you are willing to skip over the advanced concepts and come back to them later.
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html): This interactive tutorial does a particularly good job of introducing programming concepts and terminology.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book): Despite the name, some people find this to be a gentler introduction than the official Python tutorial.
* An introduction to Python through writing games: [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/)
* Learn programming by visualizing code execution: [Online Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/)

### Practicing Python

* Practice Python online with bite-sized exercises at [python CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/python).
* [NewCoder](http://newcoder.io/) is for when you get to the point where you
  say "Well, I worked through this beginner book. Now what?" It has tutorials
  on Data Visualization, APIs, Web Scraping, Networking
* The [Boston Python Workshop](http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/) has introductory and intermediate materials
    * custom [CodingBat](http://openhatch.org/wiki/CodingBat) exercises
    * [Boston Python Workshop projects](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_6/Saturday_projects)
    * [Intermediate Python Workshop Projects](http://bit.ly/intermediate-python-projects)
    * [Scrabble challenge](https://openhatch.org/wiki/Scrabble_challenge)

### Projects

If you contribute to an open source project that uses Python and want projects
for new contributors, let us know!

* Learn a Python web framework
    * Check out the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/)
    * Check out [Flask Tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/#tutorial)
* [Get started with pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)
* [Matplotlib tutorial](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/pyplot_tutorial.html)
