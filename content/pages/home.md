_When and Where_: Look for specifics at the [Chicago Pythonistas Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPythonistas).  

* [Office Hours]({filename}./officehours.md).
* [Project Night]({filename}./projectnight.md).
* [Learning Resources]({filename}./learning.md).

Come work on Python projects, get programming help, help others, and hang out.
Bring your own project or work on one of the suggested projects. Everyone
is welcome, all skill levels are encouraged. Friendly people will be around to
help beginning Python programmers with language basics and practice. If you
prefer to work on things on your own, that is okay too!

Some of us chat on #pythonprojectnight on freenode. It is handy for sharing
links to information and [pastebins](http://paste.ubuntu.com/). If you don't have an irc client, you can
connect to the channel via a web client, like
