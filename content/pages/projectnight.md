Come work on Python projects, get programming help, help others, and hang out.
Bring your own project or work on one of the suggested projects below. Everyone
is welcome, all skill levels are encouraged. Friendly people will be here to
help beginning Python programmers with language basics and practice. If you
prefer to work on things on your own, that is okay too!

Things to bring: a wireless-enabled laptop and power cord.
